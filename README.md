# Video-Analyties-

We will be using the video as input to our algorithms. The video basically
has two components:
- Visuals or series of images
- Audio
We need to extract these sub-components from the video to process it
and solve the use cases. We are only interested in the first component for
this project. Once we extract a series of images based on the use cases, we
can use algorithms or pretrained models.
